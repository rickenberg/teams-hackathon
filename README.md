# teams-hackathon
Microsoft Teams hackathon at Schultz 2020

## Agenda

1. Simple tab demo
2. Microsoft Graph tour
3. SSO tab demo

## Prerequisites

- Create a one-off mail account (e.g. outlook.com)
- Use that e-mail address to create a [Microsoft 365 developer tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) with
- If you want, load the test users and their test data in the new tenant
- Enable app [side-loading in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/)
- Install [app studio in Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/app-studio-overview) on the new tenant
- Install [yeoman and Teams templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/tutorials/get-started-yeoman)

The developer tenant is free for 90 days. To avoid problems with deleting the tenant and creating a new one with the same e-mail address, I recommend to use a one-time e-mail address for that purpose. Load the test data as mentioned in the newly created developer tenant, so you have some users and data to play with.

## Demo setup

The two demos here are based on Team tabs you deploy to your Microsoft 365 developer tenant. The code for tabs will run on your local machine. This allows a faster development cycle from making your code changes until you can see the running app in Teams. Since Teams is a cloud offering and because there is no local test bench you can install, you will need a reverse proxy, such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to route HTTP requests from the cloud to a web server on your machine.

The ngrok free version has the limitation that you cannot give it a sub domain when starting up. Every time you start up ngrok, you will hence get a new URL. When the URL of your app changes, you will have to update the manifest in Teams and, if applicable, the Azure AD application backing it.

## Simple tab demo

In this demo we create your first Team app.

1. Start ngrok: `.\ngrok.exe http 3007 -region eu`
2. Create a Teams app: `yo teams`
3. `npm install`
4. Build Teams manifest: `gulp manifest`
5. `gulp build`
6. `gulp serve`
7. Upload the manifest from `packages\...zip` to your developer tenant with app studio
8. Deploy app to a Team with app studio

## Microsoft Graph tour
